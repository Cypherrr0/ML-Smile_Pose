# Face Image Analysis: Clustering, Anomaly Detection, and Visual Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform clustering, anomaly detection, and visual analysis of facial images. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest Regression, and other machine learning algorithms to recognize smiles and predict head poses using the genki4k dataset.

## Task 1: Smile Recognition

**Method**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

We build machine learning models to recognize smiles. CNN is used as the primary method, training on image data to predict and recognize smiles.

## Task 2: Head Pose Prediction

**Method**: Random Forest Regression

Our machine learning problem is to predict the 3D pose features of the head in images using the genki4k dataset. Whatâ€™s interesting about this problem is that we not only have to deal with image data but also extract features. This is a regression problem, not the common classification problem.

## Task 3: Clustering and Anomaly Detection in Facial Images

**Method**: K-means, Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Our goal is to solve a machine learning problem, which is to cluster and detect anomalies in facial images based on features. The appeal of this problem lies in the fact that we hope to have the most typical faces in each cluster and find the most distinctive faces in the cluster, thereby deepening our understanding of features and cluster divisions.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used in this project is the genki4k dataset.
